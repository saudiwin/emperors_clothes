## Sensitive Question Designs

1.  How do you obtain a response from a survey respondent who pays a cost by answering?
2.  You cannot observe whether the response is truthful or not.
3.  Try to make the response confidential.

1.  List design is most commonly used to adjust for sensitivity bias. Example:
    1.  Roses are red.
    2.  Violets are blue.
    3.  The dictator wants to kill you.
